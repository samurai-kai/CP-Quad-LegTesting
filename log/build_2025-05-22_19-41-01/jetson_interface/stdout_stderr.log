[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindJetsonGPIO.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "JetsonGPIO", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "JetsonGPIO" with
  any of the following names:

    JetsonGPIOConfig.cmake
    jetsongpio-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "JetsonGPIO" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "JetsonGPIO_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "JetsonGPIO" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
